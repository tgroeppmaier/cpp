To perform a minimal number of comparisons, we need to take into account the following observation about binary search: the maximal number of comparisons needed to perform a binary search on a sorted sequence is the same when the number of elements is 2n
and when it is 2n+1âˆ’1. For example, looking for an element in a sorted sequence of 8 or 15 elements requires the same number of comparisons.
